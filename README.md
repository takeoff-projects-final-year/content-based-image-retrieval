Content Based Image Retrieval I’m sure that everyone knowns the full form of “CBIR” … Yes, Content Based Image Retrieval. Actually, Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is a technology that allows users to search for digital images based on their visual content, such as colors, shapes, textures, and other visual features.

Origin of CBIR: -

The origins of CBIR can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s when researchers began exploring ways to automatically analyze and retrieve images based on their visual properties.

One of the earliest pioneers of CBIR was “J. C. R. Licklider”, is credited with proposing the idea of a "man-computer symbiosis" in which humans and computers would work together to solve problems, including the retrieval of visual information.

In the 1990s, researchers such as Ramesh Jain, Anil K. Jain, and Takeo Kanade at the University of California, San Diego, and Shih-Fu Chang at Columbia University developed early CBIR systems using feature extraction and similarity matching techniques. Since then, many researchers and companies have continued to advance CBIR technology, with applications ranging from image search engines to medical diagnosis and more.

CBIR is Really Useful???

CBIR is commonly used in image search engines and applications where users can upload an image and the system returns similar images based on the content of the query image. CBIR is also used in various applications such as medical imaging, remote sensing, and video surveillance.
•	Digital asset management
•	Medical imaging
•	Crime investigation
•	Art history

Content-based image retrieval (CBIR) is used by a variety of individuals and industries, including:
•	Photographers and artists: CBIR can help photographers and artists to search for and find images that match certain criteria, such as color, composition, and style.
•	Advertising agencies: CBIR can assist advertising agencies in finding images that are relevant to their campaigns and target audiences.
•	E-commerce companies: CBIR can help e-commerce companies to recommend products to customers based on their search queries and previous purchases.
•	Medical professionals: CBIR can aid medical professionals in analyzing medical images and identifying patterns or abnormalities.
•	Law enforcement: CBIR can assist law enforcement agencies in identifying suspects by comparing images from security cameras, social media, or other sources.
•	Archivists and historians: CBIR can help archivists and historians to organize and retrieve historical images and documents.
•	Social media companies: CBIR can aid social media companies in automatically detecting and removing inappropriate or harmful content, such as hate speech or graphic violence.

Overall, CBIR can be a powerful tool for a range of applications where image search and analysis are required. However, it's important to note that the effectiveness of CBIR can depend on factors such as the quality of the image database, the features used for retrieval, and the search algorithms employed.
